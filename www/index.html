<h2>Accounting and Reporting Console (ARCo)</h2>

<p>The optional Accounting and Reporting Console (ARCo) enables you to gather 
live reporting data from the <a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net">Grid Engine</a>
system and to store the data for historical analysis in the reporting database, 
which is a standard SQL database.</p>
<p>Raw reporting data is generated by sge_qmaster. This raw data is stored in the 
$SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/reporting file. The dbwriter program reads the raw data in 
the reporting file and writes it to the SQL reporting database, where it can be accessed 
by ARCo.</p>
<p>ARCo supports the following SQL database systems:
<ul>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>Oracle</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The dbwriter provides functionality that helps you to manage your database size, 
by specifying Derived Values and Deletion Rules.</p>
<p>ARCo also provides a web-based tool, which contains a set of predefined SQL queries, 
supplementing the most frequent statistical inquiries. You can modify these queries or 
create your own. While creating your own SQL queries, you have a choice to use either 
the Simple Query builder (suitable for SQL novices) or the Advanced Query generator. 
You can specify if you want to display the data in a tabular, graphical, or pivotal form. 
You can export the data in CVS or PDF form, or store the result for later viewing. 
You also have the ability to run ARCo queries in a batch mode using the arcorun utility. 
</p>

A description how to build ARCo from source can be found <a href="arco_build.html">
<b>here</b></a> and additional hints concerning setup and installation issues can be found in 
the following <a href="arco_faq.html"><b>FAQ</b></a>. <br>
