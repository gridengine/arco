<h2>Accounting and Reporting Console (ARCo)</h2>

<p>The optional ARCo add on module enables you to gather live
accounting and reporting data from
a <a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net">Grid Engine</a>
system and store the data in a standard SQL database. ARCo also
provides a
web-based tool for generating information queries on that database and
for retrieving
the results in tabular or graphical form. ARCo enables you to store
queries for later
use, to run predefined queries, and to run queries in batch mode, for
example, overnight.</p>

<p>The official documentation how to&nbsp;use&nbsp;ARCo
can be found in the N1 Grid Engine 6 Collection:</p>
