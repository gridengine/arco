<Query tableName="" category="Accounting" name="Accounting per AR" type="advanced">
   <description>Shows the monthly accounting per Advance Reservation for the interval of one year.
                The first number shown for each row is the ar_number issued by the qmaster. Because this number
                can wrap, the second number shows the ar_id (primary key from the sge_ar table, uniquely identifying this 
                Advance Reservation).
